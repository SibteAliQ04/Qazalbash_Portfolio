## Introduction
## A proactive and motivated student with a demonstrated track record of success in public speaking, team management, leadership, data analysis, problem-solving, research, and communication. I aim to become a data scientist and leverage my skills in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning to make data-driven decisions and solve complex problems. I am passionate about understanding and interpreting large sets of data and using that knowledge to drive business growth and improve decision-making. As a student of data science, I believe that I can make a positive impact on society by using data to inform and improve decision-making in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. I am excited by the potential of data science to make a real difference in the world and I am determined to play a role in making that happen.
